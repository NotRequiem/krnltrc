# Event Monitoring with Windows Trace API
This C code demonstrates how to do a simple kernel event monitoring mechanism. It captures various events related to driver loading, unloading, image loading, image unloading, and virtual memory allocation.

## Prerequisites
- Windows operating system
- Microsoft Visual Studio or compatible C compiler
- Conio.h library for keyboard input handling

## Features
- Event Registration: Registers callback functions for specific event types using the Windows Trace API.
- Infinite Monitoring Loop: Utilizes an infinite loop to continuously monitor events until a key is pressed.

## Supported Events:
- Driver Load
- Driver Unload
- Image Load
- Image Unload
- Virtual Memory Allocation

## Usage
- Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., Visual Studio).
- Run the compiled executable on a Windows system.

## Configuration
- Adjust the delay within the infinite loop if needed (Sleep(1000); for a 1-second delay).
- Exit the monitoring loop by pressing any key.

## Code Structure
- Event Callbacks: Callback functions are provided for each monitored event type.
- Event Registration: Trace GUIDs are registered, and corresponding callbacks are associated with each event.
- Infinite Loop: The program enters an infinite loop to continuously monitor events until a key is pressed.
- Cleanup: Unregisters the trace GUIDs before exiting.
